**React data visualisation**

This is a build of a react web app to query the 'State of JS' survey results using GraphQl - based on my previous project which I called "React GraphQl experiment". This app takes the data but, instead of just displaying numerical values, uses data visualisation tools and frameworks, such as D3.js, to present the results.
