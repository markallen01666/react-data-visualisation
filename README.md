**React data visualisation**

This is a build of a react web app to use some data that I extracted from the 'State of JS' survey results API using the GraphiQl tool. This app presents the results in graphical form. Charts use tooltips to increase information presented and clarity. Charts are responsively sized.

The app is hosted on Google Firebase
